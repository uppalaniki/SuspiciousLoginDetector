# SuspiciousLoginDetector
Suspicious Login Detector: Java command-line tool to detect anomalous user login behaviour
Tools: Java, CSV, Java Time API, Java Collections

- Developed a Java-based tool to log and analyse user login activity for identifying suspicious behaviour such as multiple logins within a short period of time or fast country switching.
- Implemented detection logic for country switching within 60 minutes and more than 3 logins within 1 minute, enhancing the accuracy of detecting anomalies.
- Created CSV-based logging and created summary alert reports on program exit to simulate audit records
- Applied behavioural anomaly detection techniques and event logging to simulate real-world cybersecurity monitoring.
